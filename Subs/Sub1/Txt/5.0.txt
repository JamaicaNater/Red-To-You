Being overworked and barely sleeping.

Edit: To clarify, this isn't meant to be an insult. I know exactly how it feels to work an ungodly amount of hours with little to no reprieve. It's a routine that's become ingrained in us and I think it's important to remember being overworked, under slept, and having little to no time to ourselves is not healthy.
