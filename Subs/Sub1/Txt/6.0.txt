You ever see a police officers wife?  It's crazy but they turn their entire existence into being a police spouse, it's very odd.   I have two neighbors that are police, they younger the wife the more intense the alternate reality they create for themselves.  The husbands never mention their profession but the wifes cant shut up about it and try and prove how much they know about local law enforcement.
